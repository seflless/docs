**How to Install Decode (macOS only)**

Thanks for trying **Decode** — a visual tool for turning your ideas into software.

Since this app is not yet notarized by Apple, you’ll need to follow a few quick steps to allow it to run on your Mac. This process is safe and takes less than a minute.

## Step 1: Download and Open the `.dmg`

1. Download the `Decode.dmg` file from the website or link you received.
2. Double-click the `.dmg` file to open it.
3. Drag the **Decode** app into your **Applications** folder.

## Step 2: Run Decode

macOS will block the app from opening.

1. Open **Applications** and double-click **Decode**.
2. You’ll see a message that says:

   > “Decode” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

   This happens because the app isn’t notarized yet (Apple hasn’t scanned it), even though it’s **safely signed by the developer**.

## Step 3: Allow Decode to Run

1. Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**)
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the section that says:

   > "**Decode** was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"

4. Click **“Open Anyway”**
5. A new prompt will appear — click **Open** to confirm

This will launch **Decode**, and you won’t have to do this again.

**✅ You’re Done!**

Decode is now installed and ready to use. You can launch it anytime from your Applications folder or Spotlight.

## Is it Safe?

Yes. The app is **digitally signed** with the developer’s verified Apple ID. It hasn’t been notarized yet (Apple’s malware scan), but it hasn’t been modified and macOS knows who created it.

We’re working on full notarization soon to make this step unnecessary.

## Troubleshooting

If you still can’t open the app:

- Right-click (or Control-click) the **Decode.app** file and choose **Open**
- This can sometimes bypass the block without going through System Settings
